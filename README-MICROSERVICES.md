> Deprecated: This document has been consolidated into the root README.

Please use the canonical guide instead:

- Root README: ./README.md (Quick start, envs, ports, and scripts)
- Backend env template: ./backend/.env.example
- Frontend env template: ./hotel-booking-frontend/.env.example

Note: The previous monolith and any archived folders are no longer used. The active services live under `backend/services` and are started via the scripts in the root `package.json`.
